# What is this about?
Hydra is a powerful tool, but remembering the exact syntax is tedious.

This plain static webpage helps building hydra commands with a GUI.

# How do I use it?
If you don't know how to use html you really shoudn't use hydra.
But apart from that: Just open the file in a browser, there are no external dependencies.
Click yourself through the options and copy the command at the end.
